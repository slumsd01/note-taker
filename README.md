## Description

[This online application](https://evening-reef-07780.herokuapp.com/) can be used to store notes and tasks in an easy to read list. 

## Usage
After opening the landing page, the user is able to create new notes, or view their previously stored notes. After entering a new note's title and description, a save button appears, allowing the user to save the new note to their to-do list. They may also click the plus sign in the top right corner of the page to refresh or clear the entry forms. The to-do list and notes are saved even when the page is closed or refreshed, so users do not have to worry about losing their data.

## Installation

This application was built using basic HTML, CSS, and Javascript. But it also requires npms such as [Express](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express) and [Uniqid](https://www.npmjs.com/package/uniqid) for basic functionality.
